    <h1>A short story!</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <strong>Whiskers the Bunny</strong>
    <div1>
        <p>Whiskers, a tiny bunny with soft white fur, loved exploring the meadow, hopping between flowers and chasing butterflies. One sunny afternoon, 
            she stumbled upon a hidden patch of sweet, juicy clover, nestled under a shady oak tree. Delighted, she nibbled away, her little nose twitching in joy. 
            From then on, it became her secret spot, where she could always find peace, a tasty snack, and the soft whisper of the breeze in the trees, reminding her she was never truly alone.</p>

    <strong>Jerry the Snail</strong>
    <div1>
        <p>Jerry was a slow, thoughtful snail who loved rainy days. While most creatures hurried to find shelter, Jerry enjoyed the soft drumming of rain on leaves. 
            One drizzly morning, he set out on a grand adventure—well, grand for a snail—crossing a wide, muddy path. It took him all day, but he didn’t mind. When he 
            finally reached the other side, he found a perfect spot under a big, leafy plant. To Jerry, it wasn’t just a plant; it was a castle, and he smiled, proud of his slow but steady journey.</p>
